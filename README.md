## Useful Commands

I decided to start this repository so I can easily find (and register) useful commands that I have to use frequently. I've split this commands by topic. So far I have created the following structure:

- [curl - commands to send requests to RESTful APIs](./curl/)
- [jekyll - commands to control the blog engine used by Auth0](./jekyll/)
- [docker - commands to spin Docker instances and other Docker related commands](./docker/)
- [spring - commands related to Spring](./spring/)
- [editorconfig - config examples](./editorconfig/)
- [bash - for now, just  backup](./bash/)
- [bash - for now, just `bash_profile` backup](./bash/)
